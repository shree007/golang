Problem statement:
New version of chart is not being added for same chart name in index file

Option: (first time)
1. create empty index file in target directory
2. package helm chart to target directory
3. add tgz to index file of target directory 

Now new one:
1. remove existing one and try to add in index.file

what worked (condtion: only one tgz file)
step:
first create package
1. helm package helm/charts/kube-prometheus-stack -d temp-helm-storage

2. helm repo index  temp-helm-storage --merge temp-helm-storage/index.yaml
  

helm package helm/charts/prometheus-adapter -d temp-helm-storage

Troubleshooting step:
1. downloaded file from artifactory
it has following content 

apiVersion: v1
entries: {}
generated: 2024-11-10T09:12:16.757090406Z

and index has this 

INFO[0001] &{map[] v1 2024-11-10 09:12:16.757090406 +0000 UTC map[] [] map[]} 

2. check entries from helm/charts dir 

entries:
INFO[0001] [d kube-prometheus-stack/ d prometheus-adapter/] 

3. entry.Name, index 

kube-prometheus-stack&{map[] v1 2024-11-10 09:12:16.757090406 +0000 UTC map[] [] map[]}prometheus-adapter&{map[] v1 2024-11-10 09:12:16.757090406 +0000 UTC map[] [] map[]}

What is not working:
1. current code is overrding to index file not
